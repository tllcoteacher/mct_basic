The student then re-partitioned both wholes into tenths so that 1/2 became 5/10 and 1/5 became 2/10. After establishing tenths as a shared unit, the student counted tenths to conclude that 1/2 + 1/5 = 7/10."

They can express 1/2 = 5/10 and 1/5 = 2/10, add 5/10 + 2/10 = 7/10, and justify 10 as a shared denominator by appealing to 2x5=10 and 5x2=10. However, they did not yet articulate the identity property of multiplication (for example, multiplying numerator and denominator by the same number does not change the value of the fraction). This places them between Level 5 and Level 6."

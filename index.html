            <h1>Math CoTeacher</h1>
            <p><strong>The first AI teacher that models how math understanding actually develops and and uses that to build solid math foundations.</strong></p>
            <p>Three out of four 8th graders in America are below proficient in math. Math CoTeacher will fix that, running one-on-one diagnostic conversations, pinpointing misconceptions on a cognitive learning trajectory, and teaching like an expert human, at scale.</p>
            <p><em>Built by a Math Teacher of the Year and two-time founder who created a proven cognitive map from arithmetic to algebra.</em></p>

            <h2>Generational Failing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>60 years of failing math scores and a flat trendline.</strong> Five generations of kids thinking they’re bad at math because they were short changed in their education is a quiet tragedy.</li>
                <li><strong>Parents are blind.</strong> Kids get A's or B's while building shaky foundations. No one sees they built a house of cards until it's too late.</li>
                <li><strong>The core issue:</strong> no system actually models how understanding develops or where a specific learner sits on that path.</li>
                <li><strong>It doesn't have to be this way.</strong> A great teacher + early intervention with a cognitive learning trajectory = any student can build a foundation to learn math to the highest levels.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Me</h2>
            <p><strong>I built the human version of this system, proved it in the analog world, and trained others to do it.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ran <strong>hundreds of 1-on-1 cognitive interviews</strong> helping students who would have otherwise ended up as one of the 3 out of 4 Americans below proficient, build a math foundation that will enable them to learn math to the highest levels.</li>
                <li>Developed <strong>a cognitive learning trajectory that spans from Arithmetic to Algebra.</strong> It's the map.</li>
                <li>Trained teachers at scale to use cognitive learning trajectories. I know how to scale human data collection and judgment needed to post-train a model.</li>
                <li><strong>This is my life's work.</strong> Math Teacher of the Year. Classroom featured in research. Deep domain knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>2x successful founder.</strong> I understand business. Before teaching I consulted for multi-nationals, turned around a failing company, and had two successful startups of my own.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="emphasis">I have the framework, the data playbook, and the accumulated wisdom in business and education to bring this to life. No one else has this mix.</p>

            <h2>From Math CoTeacher to Universal Teacher</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>[Now]</strong> Math CoTeacher ($70 billion)</li>
                <li><strong>[Next]</strong> Extend to other K-12 subjects ($1 trillion)</li>
                <li><strong>[Future]</strong> A universal teacher ($7.5 trillion)</li>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Elicit:</strong> Student solves a problem. AI elicits the student’s reasoning, not just their answers.</li>
                <li><strong>Log:</strong> the entire interaction as training data, utterances, inferred state, chosen teaching move, and outcome as training data.</li>
                <li><strong>Diagnose:</strong> AI maps the reasoning onto a detailed cognitive learning trajectory: Ex: “Accurate visual fraction arithmetic, accurate multiplicative justification, fragile on formal symbolic identity, level 5”</li>
                <li><strong>Learn:</strong> Every interaction trains the system. Framework gets sharper. Instruction gets tighter.</li>
                <li><strong>Teach:</strong> Meet the learner exactly where they are developmentally with the best lesson, explanation, worked example, and practice problems to move them up the stack.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="emphasis">See what the data from a sample interaction in <a href="fraction_interview.json" download>JSON</a> or <a href="fraction_interview1.jsonl" download>JSONL</a> format looks like.</p>

            <h2>From Math to Universal Teacher: Experiment Power at Scale</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cognitive scientists</strong> know how to make maps (cognitive learning trajectories). Teachers learn how to use them.</li>
                <li><strong>CoTeacher</strong> can learn to do both. This is experiment power AND diffusion of that knowledge at scale, which is unimaginable today.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning the meta skill of map making</strong> as we sharpen math and move into other K-12 subjects provides the training ground for learning a domain-general algorithm for building cognitive learning trajectories (CLTs).</li>
                <li><strong>Math CoTeacher</strong> will be the first instance of a larger thing, an engine for designing, testing, and scaling how humans learn anything.</li>
                <li><strong>This is building the first factory AND the assembly line</strong> for creating maps (CLTs).</li>
                <li><strong>The power of compounding:</strong> each new CLT makes CoTeacher exponentially more valuable. Everyone wants a data moat. CoTeacher will have an unassailable data moat and flywheel effects it can ride to becoming the world's universal teacher.</li>

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p><strong>Build the founding team. Raise a seed round. Deploy an MVP with design partners by December.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Co-founder:</strong> AI/ML engineer who wants to do the most meaningful work of their life.</li>
                <li><strong>Investor:</strong> who wants to back the team that ends education's 60-year plateau and gets to tell the canonical story about being the first investor in the most important company in history.</li>

            <h2>Frustration</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>If you're here, you are likely good at math.</li>
                <li>Most of America and the world is not.</li>
                <li>You likely can't relate to the daily frustration that turns to apathy for students or to the anxiety elementary school teachers feel about teaching the math they never really learned themselves.</li>
                <li>That's <strong>the Curse of Knowledge,</strong> not any moral failing.</li>
                <li><strong><a href="math.html">Try this.</a></strong> See if it can help you feel a little bit of what math class is like for the 3 out of 4 8th graders in America who are below proficient and why Math CoTeacher could be such a boon for mathematics education.</li>
                <li>You probably *did* feel the frustration of being ahead of everyone else, being bored, not challenged, and maybe even picked on for being good at math.</li>
                <li>When I say math education in America serves no one well, that's part of what I mean. Join me and make math education effective and satisfying for every kind of student.</li>

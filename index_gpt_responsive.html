        <h3>Your district has a good curriculum and you do everything you can to help your students succeed.</h3>
        <h3>In spite of these best efforts, students are still struggling.</h3>
        <h3>So much so, that 3 out of 4 U.S. 8th graders are not proficient in math.</h3>

        <h3>In the progression of mathematical learning, making the leap from additive thinking to multiplicative reasoning is the linchpin to success in mathematics.</h3>
        <h3>If students fall behind on making the leap to multiplicative reasoning in 3rd, they can enter a downward spiral.</h3>
        <h3>Every day instruction becomes harder for students to make sense of.</h3>
        <h3>Unfortunately research shows that once students struggle, they don't recover.</h3>

        <h3>As a classroom teacher I learned how to help students make the leap to multiplicative reasoning.</h3>
        <h3>Using student interviews and frameworks based on decades of research myself and my colleagues learned how to uncover students at risk of not making the leap to multiplicative reasoning, or those who were already behind. Then work to get them back on track.</h3>
        <h3>The problem, after awareness, and then knowing what to do, was always time.</h3>
        <h3>Ten years ago I mapped out what I would want from technology to help my students. Over that period, the technology has developed to make that possible.</h3>
        <h3>Now it is time to make that a reality. Taking the best of what teachers, steeped in decades of research, refined in the classrom can do to help students, captured in an app that can work 1:1 with as many students as needed.</h3>

      <p>"This framework opened the door for me to learn more math content and to deepen my understanding of how students learn it. I’m more confident and a better teacher because of it."</p>
      <h3>- Cindy, 3rd grade teacher</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="testimonial-item">
      <p>"My wife and I aren’t ‘math people’ but our son is. We credit so much of that to him building a strong foundation with these methods in kindergarten. He is showing a deep understanding of the math he learned in K, 1st, 2nd, and now 3rd grade as a result."</p>

    <div class="testimonial-item">
      <p>"No more math fights or frustration! My daughter struggled in 4th grade and then fell off of a cliff in 5th grade math. This framework uncovered her reasoning abilities, helped her quickly get back on track, and not long after ended the nightly math fights, tears, and frustration we would have about math homework."</p>

        <h2>Why does that matter?</h2>
        <p>Your district has a good curriculum and you do everything you can to help your students succeed. In spite of these best efforts, students are still struggling.</p>
        <p>So much so, that 3 out of 4 U.S. 8th graders are not proficient in math.</p>
        <img src="three.jpg" alt="3 out of 4 are not proficient" class="challenge-image">
        <h3>Why does this happen?</h3>
        <p>In the progression of mathematical learning, making the leap from additive thinking to multiplicative reasoning is the linchpin to success in mathematics.</p>
        <p>If students fall behind on this in 3rd grade, they can enter a downward spiral. Everyday instruction becomes harder to make sense of.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately research shows that once students struggle, they don't recover.</p>

        <h2>It doesn't have to be this way.</h2>
        <p>As a classroom teacher I learned how to help students make the leap to multiplicative reasoning.</p>
        <p>Using student interviews and research-based frameworks, my colleagues and I uncovered students at risk and got them back on track.</p>
        <p>The problem was always time. Ten years ago I mapped out what I wanted from technology to help. Now that technology is ready.</p>
        <p>It's time to make it a reality - taking the best of what expert teachers can do and capturing it in an app that can provide 1:1 support to all students.</p>

        <h1 class="main-heading">The Future of Learning, Anything </h1>
        <p>
            Math is the beginning. An engine to drive learning for anything is the end.
            </p>
         <p> The secret is cognitive frameworks. 
            </p>
            <p>Why now? To answer that ask 'What does generative AI need for training?' High quality data. 
                
                </p>
            <p>What kind of high quality data? Reasoning traces. 
                
                </p>
            <p>When I use the arithmetic to algebra cognitive framework with a student, what do I elecit? Student reasoning traces and teacher reasoning traces. In other words, high quality data.</p>
        
            <p> I did this as a teacher. I taught this to other teachers. I developed my own Arithmetic to Algebra cognitive framework over the past decade.</p>
            <p> I have the framework, the know how, and the ability to create the data needed at scale. </p>
            
            
            <p>We start with math, then how do we get to a learning engine for anything?</p>
            <p>You build the machine that can build the machine.</p>
